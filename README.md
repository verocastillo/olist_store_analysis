## Project Summary
We're creating a visualization dashboard for Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract.

**Data Source:**
https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?select=olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv

The dataset was provided by Olist, and it has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers.

Some inspiration for data analysis was included in the dataset source: 
- NLP: This dataset offers a supreme environment to parse out the reviews text through its multiple dimensions.
- Clustering: Some customers didn't write a review. But why are they happy or mad?
- Sales Prediction: With purchase date information you'll be able to predict future sales.
- Delivery Performance: You will also be able to work through delivery performance and find ways to optimize delivery times.
- Product Quality: Enjoy yourself discovering the products categories that are more prone to customer insatisfaction.
- Feature Engineering: Create features from this rich dataset or attach some external public information to it.

However, with all of the data available to us, we're looking to create an interactive dashboard using Plotly and D3, where sales performance can be seen throughout the years included in the dataset, as well as the reviews and locations from customers.
